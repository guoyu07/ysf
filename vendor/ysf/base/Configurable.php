/**
 * Configurable is the interface that should be implemented by classes who support configuring
 * its properties through the last parameter to its constructor.
 *
 * The interface does not declare any method. Classes implementing this interface must declare their constructors
 * like the following:
 *
 * ```php
 * public function __constructor($param1, $param2, ..., $config = [])
 * ```
 *
 * That is, the last parameter of the constructor must accept a configuration array.
 *
 * This interface is mainly used by [[\ysf\di\Container]] so that it can pass object configuration as the
 * last parameter to the implementing class' constructor.
